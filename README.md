Worked in a team to develop a <b>system for reading energy pulses from electric meters</b>, integrating hardware and software components. Focused on the <b>software side</b>, writing a <b>PC application in C</b> using the <b>Windows API</b> for serial communication. The program handled <b>real-time pulse detection, timing measurement, and data logging.</b>

The hardware used a <b>custom circuit with an optical sensor</b> and <b>USB-to-serial interface (FT232RL)</b> to transmit data. I coordinated with hardware developers to ensure reliable signal acquisition and communication. The final tool was successfully implemented for <b>university research</b> on energy monitoring, offering accurate real-time data logging.

This project strengthened my skills in <b>low-level programming, system integration,</b> and <b>team collaboration</b> within a multidisciplinary engineering environment.
